# Zenzebz - Z Bot Rovers

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by Zenzebz on a minefield.Â  This minefield, which is rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain.

This project allows a controller to control the movements of the rovers in the minefield.


## Technologies
- Java 11

## Features

- Specify the dimensions of the minefield
- Specify the rover's starting position
- Control the rover's movements
- Control the rover's heading
- Obtain the rover's final orientation and co-ordinates
- Navigation validation (ensures the rover does not navigate outside the boundaries of the minefield)
- Sequential deployment of multiple rovers




## Execution

Within the ZBotRovers directory, navigate to the target director using the below command

```bash
cd target\classes
```

Runt the below command from within the target directory

```bash
java com.project.nirvan.Main
```
